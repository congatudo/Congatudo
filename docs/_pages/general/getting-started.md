## Choosing a robot<a id='choosing_a_robot'></a>

First, you'll need to acquire a supported robot. Make sure to thoroughly read the **[buying supported robots](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html)** documentation. The **[supported robots](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html)** page also provides remarks for each device to help you decide.

Please avoid buying unsupported robots and expecting Congatudo compatibility.

## Robot setup<a id='robot_setup'></a>

To get your robot ready for Congatudo, follow the steps in the **[Robot Setup Guide](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/installation/robot-setup.html)**. This covers connecting your robot to your local network, obtaining root access, and preparing it for installation.

Depending on your needs, you can choose between the **[Home Assistant addon](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/installation/home-assistant-installation.html)**, **[Docker](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/installation/docker-installation.html)**, or **[Standalone](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/installation/standalone-installation.html)** installation methods.
