# Congatudo or Valetudo

Valetudo and Congatudo are open-source projects that enable local-only operation of robotic vacuum cleaners, removing reliance on cloud-based services. While both share this goal, they target different brands and use distinct technical approaches.

## Valetudo

- **Supported Devices:** Primarily supports vacuum robots from brands such as Xiaomi, Roborock, and Dreame. See the [Valetudo supported devices list](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) for details.
- **How It Works:** Valetudo replaces the manufacturer's firmware by installing directly on the robot. This process requires rooting the device to gain the necessary access.

## Congatudo

- **Supported Devices:** Designed specifically for Cecotec Conga vacuum robots. The list of supported models is available [here](https://congatudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html).
- **How It Works:** Congatudo does not replace or modify the robot's firmware and does not require rooting. Instead, it acts as a cloud replacement by redirecting the robot's communication from the manufacturer's servers to a local server, allowing local control while keeping the original firmware intact.

## Key Differences

- **Device Compatibility:** Valetudo supports a variety of brands and models, whereas Congatudo is focused solely on Cecotec Conga robots.
- **Installation Method:** Valetudo requires rooting and firmware replacement on the robot. Congatudo works by redirecting network traffic, avoiding firmware changes and rooting.

In summary, both Valetudo and Congatudo provide local control over robotic vacuum cleaners, but differ in their supported devices and installation methods. Choose the project that best matches your robot and your preferred approach to local control.
