# Why Donate?

Your donation to Congatudo goes towards supporting the project.

The funds will be used to purchase:

- Maintaining the domain [congatudo.cloud](congatudo.cloud)
- Setting up a small build infrastructure using a Raspberry Pi, install HA OS and keep the [Congatudo addon](https://github.com/congatudo/congatudo-add-on) working!
- IoT and enterprise devices for my [home lab](https://github.com/elraro/home-ops) (I have a rack in my house!)

Keep in mind that I work full-time and can't devote all my time to these projects, so please be patient 🙏

Thank you for taking the time to read this! 🙋‍♂️
