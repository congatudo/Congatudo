Valetudo Tray Companion (Windows) offers a tray icon, which on right-click provides you with a list of Valetudo instances on your network.
Clicking on one of them will open its Webinterface in your default browser.

Downloads, installation instructions and the sourcecode (Apache-2.0) can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-tray-companion](https://github.com/Hypfer/valetudo-tray-companion).
