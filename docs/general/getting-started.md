## Choosing a robot<a id='choosing_a_robot'></a>

First, you'll need to acquire a supported robot. Make sure to thoroughly read the **[buying supported robots](./supported-robots.md)** documentation. The **[supported robots](./supported-robots.md)** page also provides remarks for each device to help you decide.

Please avoid buying unsupported robots and expecting Congatudo compatibility.

## Robot setup<a id='robot_setup'></a>

To get your robot ready for Congatudo, follow the steps in the **[Robot Setup Guide](../installation/robot-setup.md)**. This covers connecting your robot to your local network, obtaining root access, and preparing it for installation.

Depending on your needs, you can choose between the **[Home Assistant addon](../installation/home-assistant-installation.md)**, **[Docker](../installation/docker-installation.md)**, or **[Standalone](../installation/standalone-installation.md)** installation methods.
