# Supported Robots

This page features an autogenerated overview of all robots supported by Congatudo including their supported capabilities.<br/>
To find out what those do, check out the [capabilities overview](../usage/capabilities-overview.md) section of the docs.

You also might want to take a look at the [Buying supported robots](./buying-supported-robots.md) page.

This is just the autogenerated overview because it's hard to write documentation for everything and keep that up to date. <br/>
Keep in mind that rooting instructions will differ for each of these **or might not even be available at all**.

There's also some more information regarding whether or not you should buy a specific robot below the table.

The recommended Congatudo binary architectures armv7, armv7-lowmem and aarch64 are also listed for every robot. Even though
armv7 binaries work on aarch64 robots, using the correct binary for your robot is recommended.

Again:<br/>
This is just an autogenerated overview based on the codebase at the time of generation.<br/>
Don't take this as "Everything listed here will be 100% available and work all the time".<br/>
