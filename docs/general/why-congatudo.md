# Why Congatudo?

Congatudo is designed for users who value privacy, control, and transparency in their smart devices. Instead of relying on cloud services and proprietary systems, Congatudo puts you in charge of your robot and its data. Here’s why Congatudo stands out:

## Key Goals and Advantages

### Local Control, No Cloud Dependency

Congatudo operates entirely offline, ensuring your data remains on your device. You don’t need an internet connection to manage your robot, and commands execute quickly without detouring through remote servers. This approach also means your robot continues to work even if the manufacturer ends support or shuts down their servers—a common problem with many IoT devices.

### Freedom from Forced Updates

With Congatudo, you decide when and how to update your device. There are no mandatory firmware updates that might remove features or cause issues. You maintain ownership and control, avoiding risks like bricked devices or unwanted changes.

### No Accounts or Personal Data Required

Congatudo never asks for your email, phone number, or other personal information. Your privacy is protected, and you’re not exposed to data breaches or forced to accept lengthy terms of service just to use your robot.

### Ad-Free Experience

You won’t receive ads, marketing emails, or push notifications from Congatudo. The focus is on functionality, not upselling or cross-promotion.

### Open Source and Transparent

Congatudo is open-source under a permissive license. You can inspect, modify, and share the code freely. Comprehensive documentation and clear code structure make it easy to understand how everything works—no hidden features or locked-down knowledge.

### Considerations

By choosing Congatudo, you take responsibility for updates and remote access setup. While you lose some convenience offered by manufacturer cloud services, you gain full control and independence.
