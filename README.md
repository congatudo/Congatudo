</div>

Congatudo is a cloud replacement for vacuum robots enabling local-only operation. It is not a custom firmware.
That means that it cannot change anything about how the robot operates.

Congatudo provides control over your vacuum robot via a **responsive webinterface** that works on all of your devices.
It can be used on phones, tablets as well as your desktop computer.
