# Donors to the Congatudo project

Congatudo is a non-profit project developed by a community of voluntary
contributors, as well as occasional paid contributors thanks to the financial
support of generous donors.

The ways to donate to the project, as well as details on how the funds are
used, are described on [Congatudo's website](https://congatudo.cloud/general/donate/).
